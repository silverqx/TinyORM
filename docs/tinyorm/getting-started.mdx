## Introduction

TinyORM is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using TinyORM, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, TinyORM models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

:::note
Before getting started, be sure to configure a database connection in your application. For more information on configuring your database, check out the [database configuration documentation](database/getting-started.mdx#configuration).
:::

:::tip
If you want to see a model in which are used all possible TinyORM features you can look at the [`torrent.hpp`](https://github.com/silverqx/TinyORM/blob/main/tests/models/models/torrent.hpp) in the TinyORM's tests, this `Models::Torrent` class serves also as a showcase, so all possible features are defined in it.
:::

## Generating Model Classes

To get started, let's create the simplest TinyORM model. Models typically live in the `database\models` directory and extend the `Orm::Tiny::Model` class. You may use the `make:model` command to generate a new model:

```bash
tom make:model User
```

If you would like to generate a database [migration](/database/migrations.mdx) or [seeder](/database/seeding.mdx) when you generate the model, you may use the `--migration`/`-m` or `--seeder`/`-s` options:

```bash
tom make:model User --migration --seeder
```

The `--force` option forces overwriting of existing files:

```bash
tom make:model User --migration --seeder --force
```

The `make:model` is king 👑 among scaffolding commands that you can use to generate complete TinyORM model classes, it supports all features that TinyORM models offer. All advanced features are described in the `make:model` help command:

```bash
tom make:model --help
```

Few examples:

```powershell
# Setting some model attributes
tom make:model User --table=users --fillable=name,email,banned_at `
                    --guarded=password --dates=banned_at

# Generate relationship methods
tom make:model User --one-to-one=Passport `
                    --one-to-many=Post --foreign-key=post_id `
                    --one-to-many=Car

# Generate a basic many-to-many relationship
tom make:model User --belongs-to-many=Tag --with-timestamps

# Generate a many-to-many relationship
tom make:model User --belongs-to-many=Tag --foreign-key=tag_id `
                    --pivot-table=user_tag --as=tagged `
                    --with-pivot=active,soft --with-timestamps `
                    --pivot=Tagged

# Generate a pivot model
tom make:model Tagged --pivot-model
tom make:model Tagged --pivot-model --incrementing
```

:::tip
Writing a `make:model` commands is superb with the [tab completion](/database/migrations.mdx#tab-completion).
:::

:::note
The `--path` and `--realpath` options work the same as for the [`make:migration`](/database/migrations.mdx#generating-migrations) command.

## TinyORM Model Conventions

Let's examine a basic model class and discuss some of TinyORM's key conventions:

    #pragma once
    #ifndef FLIGHT_HPP
    #define FLIGHT_HPP

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;

        using Model::Model;
    };

    #endif // FLIGHT_HPP

:::tip
The `TinyORM` source tree contains the [`Torrent`](https://github.com/silverqx/TinyORM/blob/main/tests/models/models/torrent.hpp#L43) example model that also acts as the full-fledged example model. It has defined and also nicely commented all possible features that model classes can use or define.
:::

### Table Names

After glancing at the example above, you may have noticed that we did not tell TinyORM which database table corresponds to our `Flight` model. By convention, the "snake_case", plural name of the class will be used as the table name unless another name is explicitly specified. So, in this case, TinyORM will assume the `Flight` model stores records in the `flights` table, while an `AirTrafficController` model would store records in an `air_traffic_controllers` table.

If your model's corresponding database table does not fit this convention, you may manually specify the model's table name by defining the private `u_table` data member on the model:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The table associated with the model. */
        QString u_table {"flights"};
    };

### Primary Keys

TinyORM will also assume that each model's corresponding database table has a primary key column named `id`. If necessary, you may define a private `u_primaryKey` data member on your model to specify a different column that serves as your model's primary key:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The primary key associated with the table. */
        QString u_primaryKey {"id"};
    };

In addition, TinyORM assumes that the primary key is an incrementing integer value. If you wish to use a non-incrementing or a non-numeric primary key you must define a private `u_incrementing` data member on your model that is set to `false`:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! Indicates if the model's ID is auto-incrementing. */
        bool u_incrementing = false;
    };

:::caution
Non-numeric primary keys are not currently implemented, `u_incrementing` code logic is fully implemented, but it is only one part to make it fully work.
:::

#### "Composite" Primary Keys

TinyORM requires each model to have at least one uniquely identifying "ID" that can serve as its primary key. "Composite" primary keys are not supported by TinyORM models. However, you are free to add additional multi-column unique indexes to your database tables, in addition to the table's uniquely identifying primary key.

### Timestamps

By default, TinyORM expects `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to exist on your model's corresponding database table.  TinyORM will automatically set these column's values when models are created or updated. If you do not want these columns to be automatically managed by TinyORM, you should define a private `u_timestamps` data member on your model with a value of `false`:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! Indicates if the model should be timestamped. */
        bool u_timestamps = false;
    };

<a id='timestamps-u_dates' />

The `u_dates` static data member controls the casting of timestamp attributes. The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are automatically added to the `u_dates` string list when the `u_timestamps` is `true`. Also, the [`Soft Deleting`](#soft-deleting) feature adds the `deleted_at` column to the `u_dates`.

You may add additional columns to the `u_dates` list. After that, these columns will be automatically formatted using the format in the `u_dateFormat` data member during the `setAttribute` method call:

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The attributes that should be mutated to dates. */
        inline static const QStringList u_dates {"departure_at"};
    };

If you need to customize the format of your model's timestamps, set the private `u_dateFormat` data member on your model. This data member determines how date attributes are stored in the database, supported formats are described in the `QDateTime` documentation:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The storage format of the model's date columns. */
        QString u_dateFormat {"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"};
    };

##### Unix timestamps

You can set the `u_dateFormat` to `U` if you want to store dates in the database as unix timestamps:

    QString u_dateFormat {QLatin1Char('U')};

In this case __all__ date attributes set in the `u_dates` will be handled as unix timestamps, so also the `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp attributes.

To create unix timestamp columns using the [tom migrations](/database/migrations.mdx) you should use `integer` types:

    Schema::table("flights", [](Blueprint &table)
    {
        table.bigInteger("created_at").nullable();
        table.bigInteger("updated_at").nullable();
    });

##### Custom timestamp column names

If you need to customize the names of the columns used to store the timestamps, you may define `CREATED_AT` and `UPDATED_AT` private static getter methods on your model:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The name of the "created at" column. */
        inline static QString CREATED_AT() { return QStringLiteral("creation_date"); }
        /*! The name of the "updated at" column. */
        inline static QString UPDATED_AT() { return QStringLiteral("updated_date"); }
    };

#### Touching timestamps

You can explicitly touch timestamps using the `touch` method defined on the Model:

    auto flight = Flight::find(1);

    flight->touch();
    flight->touch("added_on"); // Custom column name

You can also touch multiple rows at once using the `touch` method defined on the TinyBuilder:

    auto [affected, query] = Flight::whereEq("status", "new")->touch();

The `touch` method may also be called when building a [relationship](/tinyorm/relationships.mdx) query:

    flight->history()->touch();
    flight->history()->whereEq("status", "new").touch();

### Database Connections

By default, all TinyORM models will use the default database connection that is configured for your application. If you would like to specify a different connection that should be used when interacting with a particular model, you should define a `u_connection` private data member on the model:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The database connection that should be used by the model. */
        QString u_connection {"sqlite"};
    };

In special cases, when you want to query the database through a different connection, you can use `Model::on` method, which takes the connection name as the first argument:

    auto user = User::on("sqlite")->find(1);

## Default Attribute Values

By default, a newly instantiated model instance will not contain any attribute values. If you would like to define the default values for some of your model's attributes, you may define an `u_attributes` data member on your model, it has to be **static** and can be **const**:

    #include <QDateTime>

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The model's default values for attributes. */
        inline static const QVector<AttributeItem> u_attributes {
            {"delayed",  false},
            {"progress", 0},
            {"added_on", QDateTime::currentDateTimeUtc()},
        };
    };

:::caution
Use the `Model::instance` or `Model::instanceHeap` related methods to instantiate a model that contains a `QDateTime` in Default Attribute Values, or if attributes you want to pass to the model's constructor contain a `QDateTime` instance <small>(problem is described below)</small>.
:::

##### QDateTime and connection name problem

If your Default Attribute Values or attributes that you can pass to the `Model` constructor contain the `QDateTime` instance, then `TinyORM` throws an exception. You have to use the `Model::instance` related methods to create such a Model.

Virtually everything important is covered in the thrown exception, but let me summarize it. The problem is that the `QDateTime` instance is converted to a string based on the `Model::u_dateFormat`, or if not defined, the date format from `Orm::Query::Grammars::Grammar` will be used. This `QueryGrammar` is obtained from `Orm::DatabaseConnection` and because of that TinyORM needs to know the __connection name__ and that's the crux of this problem. You can define your connection name using the `Model::u_connection` in your derived model class, but this derived model __is not yet initialized__, so the `Model::u_connection` is also not initialized.

So if the `Model::u_connection` is not yet initialized, `TinyORM` can't obtain the `Orm::DatabaseConnection` -> `QueryGrammar` -> `dateFormat`.

## Retrieving Models

Once you have created a model and its associated database table, you are ready to start retrieving data from your database. You can think of each TinyORM model as a powerful [query builder](database/query-builder.mdx) allowing you to fluently query the database table associated with the model. The model's `all` method will retrieve all of the records from the model's associated database table:

    #include <QDebug>

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    for (const auto &flight : Flight::all())
        qDebug() << flight["name"].toString();

#### Building Queries

The TinyORM `all` method will return all of the results in the model's table. However, since each TinyORM model serves as a [query builder](database/query-builder.mdx), you may add additional constraints to queries and then invoke the `get` method to retrieve the results:

    auto flights = Flight::whereEq("active", 1)
               ->orderBy("name")
               .take(10)
               .get();

:::tip
Since TinyORM models are query builders, you should review all of the methods provided by TinyORM's [query builder](database/query-builder.mdx). You may use any of these methods when writing your TinyORM queries.
:::

:::note
All the static methods defined on the `Orm::Tiny::Model<Derived, AllRelations...>` class, which start building queries like `where`, `latest`, `oldest`, `with`, ... return `std::unique_ptr<TinyBuilder<Model>>`, `TinyBuilder = Orm::Tiny::Builder` and `Model` template argument is queried model class.
:::

#### Refreshing Models

If you already have an instance of the TinyORM model that was retrieved from the database, you can "refresh" the model using the `fresh` and `refresh` methods. The `fresh` method will re-retrieve the model from the database. The existing model instance will not be affected:

    auto flight = Flight::whereEq("number", "FR 900")->first();

    auto freshFlight = flight->fresh();

The `refresh` method will re-hydrate the existing model using fresh data from the database. In addition, all of its loaded relationships will be refreshed as well:

    auto flight = Flight::whereEq("number", "FR 900")->first();

    flight->setAttribute("number", "FR 456");

    flight->refresh();

    flight->getAttribute("number"); // "FR 900"

### Containers

As we have seen, TinyORM methods like `all` and `get` retrieve multiple records from the database. Since these methods return a `QVector<Model>`, you can iterate it like any other container with the [Range-based for loop](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for), [STL-Style Iterators](https://doc.qt.io/qt/containers.html#stl-style-iterators), [Java-Style Iterators](https://doc.qt.io/qt/containers.html#java-style-iterators) or [Ranges](https://www.walletfox.com/course/quickref_range_v3.php).

    #include <QDebug>

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    for (const auto &flight : Flight::all())
        qDebug() << flight["name"].toString();

:::note
An `all` method is defined on the `Orm::Tiny::Model<Derived, AllRelations...>` class and `get` method is defined on the `Orm::Tiny::Builder`, may be also referred as `TinyBuilder`, and on the `Orm::Query::Builder` alias `QueryBuilder`.
:::

### Chunking Results

Your application may run out of memory if you attempt to load tens of thousands of TinyORM records via the `all` or `get` methods. Instead of using these methods, the `chunk` method may be used to process large numbers of models more efficiently.

The `chunk` method will retrieve a subset of TinyORM models, passing them to a lambda expression for processing. Since only the current chunk of TinyORM models is retrieved at a time, the `chunk` method will provide significantly reduced memory usage when working with a large number of models:

    Flight::chunk(200, [](QVector<Flight> &&flights, const int /*unused*/)
    {
        for (auto &&flight : flights) {
            //
        }

        return true;
    });

The first argument passed to the `chunk` method is the number of records you wish to receive per "chunk". The lambda expression passed as the second argument will be invoked for each chunk that is retrieved from the database. A database query will be executed to retrieve each chunk of records passed to the lambda expression.

If you are filtering the results of the `chunk` method based on a column that you will also be updating while iterating over the results, you should use the `chunkById` method. Using the `chunk` method in these scenarios could lead to unexpected and inconsistent results. Internally, the `chunkById` method will always retrieve models with an `id` column greater than the last model in the previous chunk:

    Flight::whereEq("departed", true)
        ->chunkById(200, [](QVector<Flight> &&flights, const int /*unused*/)
        {
            for (auto &&flight : flights)
                flight.update({{"departed", false}});

            return true;
        });

### Advanced Subqueries

#### Subquery Selects

TinyORM also offers advanced subquery support, which allows you to pull information from related tables in a single query. For example, let's imagine that we have a table of flight `destinations` and a table of `flights` to destinations. The `flights` table contains an `arrived_at` column which indicates when the flight arrived at the destination.

Using the subquery functionality available to the query builder's `select` and `addSelect` methods, we can select all of the `destinations` and the name of the flight that most recently arrived at that destination using a single query:

    #include "models/destination.hpp"
    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    return Destination::addSelect(
            Flight::select("name")
                ->whereColumnEq("destination_id", "destinations.id")
                .orderByDesc("arrived_at")
                .limit(1)
                .toBase(),
            "last_flight")
        ->get();

#### Subquery Ordering

In addition, the query builder's `orderBy` function supports subqueries. Continuing to use our flight example, we may use this functionality to sort all destinations based on when the last flight arrived at that destination. Again, this may be done while executing a single database query:

    return Destination::orderByDesc(
            Flight::select("arrived_at")
                ->whereColumnEq("destination_id", "destinations.id")
                .orderByDesc("arrived_at")
                .limit(1)
                .toBase())
        ->get();

## Retrieving Single Models / Aggregates {#retrieving-single-models-and-aggregates}

In addition to retrieving all of the records matching a given query, you may also retrieve single records using the `find`, `first`, `firstWhere`, or `firstWhereEq` methods. Instead of returning a vector of models, these methods return a single model instance:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    // Retrieve a model by its primary key...
    auto flight = Flight::find(1);

    // Retrieve the first model matching the query constraints...
    auto flight = Flight::whereEq("active", 1)->first();

    // Alternative to retrieving the first model matching the query constraints...
    auto flight = Flight::firstWhere("active", "=", 1);

    // Alternative firstWhere method syntax
    auto flight = Flight::firstWhereEq("active", 1);

Sometimes you may wish to perform some other action if no results are found. The `findOr` methods will return a single model instance or, if no results are found, execute the given lambda expression. The value returned by the lambda will be considered the result of the method:

    auto flight = Flight::findOr(1, [] {
        // ...
    });

    auto flight = Flight::findOr<int>(1, [] {
        // ...
        return 10;
    });

    auto flight = Flight::findOr<std::optional<Flight>>(1, [] {
        // ...
        return Flight::find(10);
    });

To obtain only a subset of the model's attributes you may use the `Model::only` method, it returns the `QVector<AttributeItem>`:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    using Orm::Constants::ID;
    using Orm::Constants::NAME;

    auto flight = Flight::find(1);

    auto attributes = flight->only({ID, NAME});

#### Not Found Exceptions

Sometimes you may wish to throw an exception if a model is not found. The `findOrFail` and `firstOrFail` methods will retrieve the first result of the query; however, if no result is found, an `Orm::Tiny::ModelNotFoundError` will be thrown:

    auto flight = Flight::findOrFail(1);

    auto flight = Flight::where("legs", ">", 3)->firstOrFail();

### Retrieving Or Creating Models

The `firstOrCreate` method will attempt to locate a database record using the given column / value pairs. If the model can not be found in the database, a record will be inserted with the attributes resulting from merging the first `QVector<Orm::WhereItem>` argument with the optional second `QVector<Orm::AttributeItem>` argument:

The `firstOrNew` method, like `firstOrCreate`, will attempt to locate a record in the database matching the given attributes. However, if a model is not found, a new model instance will be returned. Note that the model returned by `firstOrNew` has not yet been persisted to the database. You will need to manually call the `save` method to persist it:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    // Retrieve flight by name or create it if it doesn't exist...
    auto flight = Flight::firstOrCreate({
        {"name", "London to Paris"}
    });

    // Retrieve flight by name or create it with the name, delayed, and arrival_time attributes...
    auto flight = Flight::firstOrCreate(
        {{"name", "London to Paris"}},
        {{"delayed", 1}, {"arrival_time", "11:30"}}
    );

    // Retrieve flight by name or instantiate a new Flight instance...
    auto flight = Flight::firstOrNew({
        {"name", "London to Paris"}
    });

    // Retrieve flight by name or instantiate with the name, delayed, and arrival_time attributes...
    auto flight = Flight::firstOrNew(
        {{"name", "Tokyo to Sydney"}},
        {{"delayed", 1}, {"arrival_time", "11:30"}}
    );

### Retrieving Aggregates

When interacting with TinyORM models, you may also use the `count`, `sum`, `max`, and other [aggregate methods](/database/query-builder.mdx#aggregates) provided by the [query builder](/database/query-builder.mdx). As you might expect, these methods return a scalar value instead of a TinyORM model instance:

    auto count = Flight::whereEq("active", 1)->count();

    auto max = Flight::whereEq("active", 1)->max("price");

## Inserting & Updating Models {#inserting-and-updating-models}

### Inserts

Of course, when using TinyORM, we don't only need to retrieve models from the database. We also need to insert new records. Thankfully, TinyORM makes it simple. To insert a new record into the database, you should instantiate a new model instance and set attributes on the model. Then, call the `save` method on the model instance:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    // Store a new flight in the database
    Flight flight;
    flight.setAttribute("name", "Slovakia to Czech");
    flight.save();

In this example, we assign the `name` attribute of the `Flight` model instance. When we call the `save` method, a record will be inserted into the database. The model's `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps will automatically be set when the `save` method is called, so there is no need to set them manually.

Alternatively, you may use the `create` method to "save" a new model using a single C++ statement. The inserted model instance will be returned to you by the `create` method:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    auto flight = Flight::create({
        {"name", "London to Paris"},
    });

However, before using the `create` method, you will need to specify either a `u_fillable` or `u_guarded` static data member on your model class. These static data members are required because all TinyORM models are protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities by default.

### Updates

The `save` method may also be used to update models that already exist in the database. To update a model, you should retrieve it and set any attributes you wish to update. Then, you should call the model's `save` method. Again, the `updated_at` timestamp will automatically be updated, so there is no need to manually set its value:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    auto flight = Flight::find(1);

    flight->setAttribute("name", "Paris to London");

    flight->save();

#### Mass Updates

Updates can also be performed against models that match a given query. In this example, all flights that are `active` and have a `destination` of `San Diego` will be marked as delayed:

    Flight::whereEq("active", 1)
          ->whereEq("destination", "San Diego")
          .update({{"delayed", 1}});

The `update` method expects the `QVector<Orm::UpdateItem>` of column and value pairs representing the columns that should be updated.

#### Examining Attribute Changes

TinyORM provides the `isDirty`, `isClean`, and `wasChanged` methods to examine the internal state of your model and determine how its attributes have changed from when the model was originally retrieved.

The `isDirty` method determines if any of the model's attributes have been changed since the model was retrieved. You may pass a specific attribute name to the `isDirty` method to determine if a particular attribute is dirty. The `isClean` will determine if an attribute has remained unchanged since the model was retrieved. This method also accepts an optional attribute argument:

    #include "models/user.hpp"

    auto user = User::create({
        {"first_name", "Silver"},
        {"last_name", "Zachara"},
        {"title", "Developer"},
    });

    user.setAttribute("title", "Painter");

    user.isDirty(); // true
    user.isDirty("title"); // true
    user.isDirty("first_name"); // false

    user.isClean(); // false
    user.isClean("title"); // false
    user.isClean("first_name"); // true

    user.save();

    user.isDirty(); // false
    user.isClean(); // true

The `wasChanged` method determines if any attributes were changed after the model was last saved into the database. If needed, you may pass an attribute name to see if a particular attribute was changed:

    auto user = User::create({
        {"first_name", "Silver"},
        {"last_name", "Zachara"},
        {"title", "Developer"},
    });

    user.setAttribute("title", "Painter");

    user.wasChanged(); // false

    user.save();

    user.wasChanged(); // true
    user.wasChanged("title"); // true
    user.wasChanged("first_name"); // false

### Mass Assignment

You may use the `create` method to "save" a new model using a single C++ statement. The inserted model instance will be returned to you by the method:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    auto flight = Flight::create({
        {"name", "London to Paris"},
    });

However, before using the `create` method, you will need to specify either a `u_fillable` or `u_guarded` static data member on your model class. These data members are required because all TinyORM models are protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities by default.

A mass assignment vulnerability occurs when a user passes an unexpected HTTP request field and that field changes a column in your database that you did not expect. For example, a malicious user might send an `is_admin` parameter through an HTTP request, which is then passed to your model's `create` method, allowing the user to escalate themselves to an administrator.

So, to get started, you should define which model attributes you want to make mass assignable. You may do this using the `u_fillable` static data member on the model. For example, let's make the `name` attribute of our `Flight` model mass assignable:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;

        using Model::Model;

        /*! The attributes that are mass assignable. */
        inline static QStringList u_fillable {
            "name",
        };
    };

Once you have specified which attributes are mass assignable, you may use the `create` method to insert a new record in the database. The `create` method returns the newly created model instance:

    auto flight = Flight::create({{"name", "London to Paris"}});

If you already have a model instance, you may use the `fill` method to populate it with the vector of attributes:

    flight.fill({{"name", "Amsterdam to Frankfurt"}});

#### Allowing Mass Assignment

If you would like to make all of your attributes mass assignable, you may define your model's `u_guarded` static data member as an empty vector. If you choose to unguard your model, you should take special care to always hand-craft the vectors passed to TinyORM's `fill`, `create`, and `update` methods:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;

        using Model::Model;

        /*! The attributes that aren't mass assignable. */
        inline static QStringList u_guarded {};
    };

### Upserts

Occasionally, you may need to update an existing model or create a new model if no matching model exists.

In the example below, if a flight exists with a `departure` location of `Oakland` and a `destination` location of `San Diego`, its `price` and `discounted` columns will be updated. If no such flight exists, a new flight will be created which has the attributes resulting from merging the first argument vector with the second argument vector:

    auto flight = Flight::updateOrCreate(
        {{"departure", "Oakland"}, {"destination", "San Diego"}},
        {{"price", 99}, {"discounted", 1}}
    );

:::note
The `firstOrCreate` and `updateOrCreate` methods persist the model, so there's no need to manually call the `save` method.
:::

If you would like to perform multiple "upserts" in a single query, then you should use the `upsert` method instead. The method's first argument consists of the values to insert or update, while the second argument lists the column(s) that uniquely identify records within the associated table. The method's third and final argument is the vector of the columns that should be updated if a matching record already exists in the database. The `upsert` method will automatically set the `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps if timestamps are enabled on the model:

    Flight::upsert(
        {{{"departure", "Oakland"}, {"destination", "San Diego"}, {"price", 99}},
         {{"departure", "Chicago"}, {"destination", "New York"},  {"price", 150}}},
        {"departure", "destination"},
        {"price"}
    );

:::caution
All databases except SQL Server require the columns in the second argument of the `upsert` method to have a "primary" or "unique" index. In addition, the MySQL database driver ignores the second argument of the `upsert` method and always uses the "primary" and "unique" indexes of the table to detect existing records.
:::

:::info
Row and column aliases will be used with the MySQL server >=8.0.19 instead of the VALUES() function as is described in the MySQL [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.1/en/insert-on-duplicate.html). The MySQL server version is auto-detected and can be overridden in the [configuration](/database/getting-started.mdx#configuration).

## Deleting Models

To delete a model, you may call the `remove`, or an alias `deleteRow` method on the model instance:

    #include "models/flight.hpp"

    auto flight = Flight::find(1);

    flight->remove();

#### Deleting An Existing Model By Its Primary Key

In the example above, we are retrieving the model from the database before calling the `remove` method. However, if you know the primary key of the model, you may delete the model without explicitly retrieving it by calling the `destroy` method.  In addition to accepting the single primary key, the `destroy` method can accept multiple primary keys:

    Flight::destroy(1);

    Flight::destroy({1, 2, 3});

:::note
The `destroy` method loads models from the database and calls the `remove` method on each model individually, the reason for this is future compatibility with events.
:::

#### Deleting Models Using Queries

Of course, you may build the query to delete all models matching your query's criteria. In this example, we will delete all flights that are marked as inactive:

    auto deletedRows = Flight::whereEq("active", 0)->remove();

### Soft Deleting

In addition to actually removing records from your database, TinyORM can also "soft delete" models. When models are soft deleted, they are not actually removed from your database. Instead, a `deleted_at` attribute is set on the model indicating the date and time at which the model was "deleted". To enable soft deletes for a model, add the `Orm::Tiny::SoftDeletes` base class to the model:

    #include <orm/tiny/model.hpp>
    #include <orm/tiny/softdeletes.hpp>

    using Orm::Tiny::Model;
    using Orm::Tiny::SoftDeletes;

    class Flight final : public Model<Flight>,
                         public SoftDeletes<Flight>
    {
        friend Model;
        using Model::Model;

    private:
        /*! The table associated with the model. */
        QString u_table {"flights"};
    };

:::info
The `SoftDeletes` base class will automatically cast the `deleted_at` attribute to the `QDateTime` instance for you (it adds the `deleted_at` column to the model's [`u_dates`](#timestamps-u_dates) list).
:::

You should also add the `deleted_at` column to your database table. The TinyORM [schema builder](/database/migrations.mdx) contains a helper method to create this column:

    Schema::table("flights", [](Blueprint &table)
    {
        table.softDeletes();
    });

    Schema::table("flights", [](Blueprint &table)
    {
        table.dropSoftDeletes();
    });

Now, when you call the `remove` or `deleteModel` method on the model, the `deleted_at` column will be set to the current date and time. However, the model's database record will be left in the table. When querying a model that uses soft deletes, the soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from all query results.

To determine if a given model instance has been soft deleted, you may use the `trashed` method:

    if (flight->trashed()) {
        //
    }

#### Restoring Soft Deleted Models

Sometimes you may wish to "un-delete" a soft deleted model. To restore a soft deleted model, you may call the `restore` method on a model instance. The `restore` method will set the model's `deleted_at` column to `null`:

    flight->restore();

You may also use the `restore` method in a query to restore multiple models:

    Flight::withTrashed()
            ->whereEq("airline_id", 1)
            .restore();

The `restore` method may also be used when building [relationship](/tinyorm/relationships.mdx) queries:

    flight->history()->restore();

#### Permanently Deleting Models

Sometimes you may need to truly remove a model from your database. You may use the `forceDelete` method (or it's alias `forceRemove`) to permanently remove a soft deleted model from the database table:

    flight->forceDelete();

You may also use the `forceDelete` method when building TinyORM relationship queries:

    flight->history()->forceDelete();

### Querying Soft Deleted Models

#### Including Soft Deleted Models

As noted above, soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from query results. However, you may force soft deleted models to be included in a query's results by calling the `withTrashed` method on the query:

    auto flights = Flight::withTrashed()
                           ->whereEq("account_id", 1)
                           .get();

The `withTrashed` method may also be called when building a [relationship](/tinyorm/relationships.mdx) query:

    flight->history()->withTrashed().get();

#### Retrieving Only Soft Deleted Models

The `onlyTrashed` method will retrieve **only** soft deleted models:

    auto flights = Flight::onlyTrashed()
                           ->whereEq("airline_id", 1)
                           .get();

The `onlyTrashed` method may also be called when building a [relationship](/tinyorm/relationships.mdx) query:

    flight->history()->onlyTrashed().get();

#### Excluding Soft Deleted Models

As noted above, soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from query results. However, you may force soft deleted models to be **excluded** in a query's results by calling the `withoutTrashed` method on the query:

    auto flights = Flight::withoutTrashed()
                           ->whereEq("account_id", 1)
                           .get();

The `withoutTrashed` method may also be called when building a [relationship](/tinyorm/relationships.mdx) query:

    flight->history()->withoutTrashed().get();

### Truncate Table

You may call the `truncate` method to delete all of the model's associated database records. The `truncate` operation will also reset any auto-incrementing IDs on the model's associated table:

    Flight::truncate();

## Replicating Models

You may create an unsaved copy of an existing model instance using the `replicate` method. This method is particularly useful when you have model instances that share many of the same attributes:

    auto shipping = Address::create({
        {"type", "shipping"},
        {"line_1", "123 Example Street"},
        {"city", "Victorville"},
        {"state", "CA"},
        {"postcode", "90001"},
    });

    auto billing = shipping.replicate();

    billing.fill({
        {"type", "billing"},
    });

    billing.save();

To exclude one or more attributes from being replicated to the new model, you may pass an unordered_set to the `replicate` method:

    auto flight = Flight::create({
        {"destination", "LAX"},
        {"origin", "LHR"},
        {"last_flown", "2020-03-04 11:00:00"},
        {"last_pilot_id", 747},
    });

    flight = flight.replicate({
        "last_flown",
        "last_pilot_id",
    });

## Comparing Models

Sometimes you may need to determine if two models are the "same" or not. The `is` and `isNot` methods may be used to quickly verify two models have the same primary key, table, and database connection or not:

    if (post->is(anotherPost)) {
        //
    }

    if (post->isNot(anotherPost)) {
        //
    }

The `is` and `isNot` methods are also available when using the `belongsTo` and `hasOne` [relationships](/tinyorm/relationships.mdx). This method is particularly helpful when you would like to compare a related model without issuing a query to retrieve that model:

    if (post->author()->is(user)) {
        //
    }

##### Equality comparison

The base `Model` class also defines the `operator==` that allows precisely comparing two models. It compares the content of all the model's data members, from all base classes to the most derived model class. The `model1 == model2` expression guarantees that these two models are exactly the same.

It would be appropriate to mention that this comparison also includes relations, which means it will also compare __all__ models (including their data members) these relations contain.
