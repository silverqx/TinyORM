# Note:
# All conf.pri.example files (they are 4) contain a lot of commented code, personally,
# I wouldn't say I like these comments, especially after the Auto-configuration feature
# was added.
# But these comments show all possible alternatives to configure TinyORM project so
# you can quickly find out what you can use.
# Choose any method you like and remove the rest of commented code.

# Auto-configuration
# ---

# The Auto-configuration feature and tiny_dotenv qmake CONFIG were added in the TinyORM v0.34.0.
# These new features allow us to auto-configure TinyORM project, and with their help,
# the conf.pri files can be skipped entirely.
#
# The Auto-configuration feature is designed to find the vcpkg and MySQL installations, and
# tiny_dotenv to include the .env and .env.$$QMAKE_PLATFORM files in the project's root folder.
# These new features can be configured using qmake and environment variables, and they
# also contain some guessing logic if these variables are not defined.
#
# These are qmake and environment variables that affect the Auto-configuration feature:
#
# - TINY_VCPKG_ROOT    - Path to the vcpkg installation folder.
#                        If not defined, then it tries to use the VCPKG_ROOT environment
#                        variable.
# - TINY_VCPKG_TRIPLET - The vcpkg triplet to use (vcpkg/installed/$$TINY_VCPKG_TRIPLET/).
#                        If not defined, then it tries to guess the vcpkg triplet based
#                        on the current compiler and OS (based on the QMAKESPEC), and
#                        as the last thing, it tries to use the VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET
#                        environment variable.
# - TINY_MYSQL_ROOT    - Path to the MySQL installation folder.
#                        If not defined, then it tries to guess the MySQL installation folder:
#                        $$(ProgramFiles)/MySQL/MySQL Server (9.1|9.0|8.4|8.3|8.2|8.1|8.0|5.7)/)
#
# You can set these variables in the .env (recommended) or conf.pri files,
# in the .qmake.conf file (or wherever you want), or as environment variables.
#
# These variables will be set after auto-configuration is done:
#
# - TINY_VCPKG_INCLUDE - Path to the vcpkg include folder (vcpkg/installed/<triplet>/include/).
# - TINY_MYSQL_INCLUDE - Path to the MySQL include folder (MySQL Server 9.1/include/).
# - TINY_MYSQL_LIB     - Path to the MySQL lib folder (MySQL Server 9.1/lib/).
#
# The TINY_MYSQL_INCLUDE and TINY_MYSQL_LIB are only set on win32 platform except mingw.

# .env and .env.$$TINY_DOTENV_PLATFORM (tiny_dotenv feature)
# ---
#
# This feature allows us to define the .env and .env.$$TINY_DOTENV_PLATFORM files
# in the project's root folder. These files are loaded as early as possible so you can
# affect the qmake configuration process. On the other hand, the conf.pri files are
# loaded as late as possible, and they can be used to override the qmake configuration.
#
# The .env file is included first and is included on all platforms.
#
# There is only one requirement for this feature to work correctly, and that is to set
# the TINY_DOTENV_ROOT qmake variable to the project's root folder. This variable is
# already set in the .qmake.conf file for the TinyORM project.
#
# Then the following names are taken into account: .env, .env.win32, .env.unix, .env.mingw

# Tom migrations
# ---

# Default migrations path as the string for the make:migration command
# The path can be absolute or relative (to the pwd at runtime)
# It will look like this on the cmd. line: -DTINYTOM_MIGRATIONS_DIR="<path>/<path>"
# If the path doesn't contain a space then the \" is not needed
# Will be stringified in the tom/application.cpp
#DEFINES += TINYTOM_MIGRATIONS_DIR="\"database/migrations\""

# Default models path as the string for the make:model command
#DEFINES += TINYTOM_MODELS_DIR="\"database/models\""

# Default seeders path as the string for the make:seeder command
